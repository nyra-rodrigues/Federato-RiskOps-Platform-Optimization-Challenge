# Federato RiskOps Platform Optimization Challenge

This repository contains the solution to the **Federato RiskOps Platform Optimization Challenge**, where I analyzed user interaction data from the Federato RiskOps platform to identify patterns and optimize user engagement.

## Challenge Overview

The goal of the challenge was to:

- Analyze user behavior data (page visits, clicks, form entries) to identify actions influencing user retention.
- Develop a framework for optimizing the next user action to maximize platform engagement.
- Provide actionable insights for Federato to improve user experience and increase platform usage.

## Approach

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed user behavior to uncover key trends impacting engagement.
- **Optimization Framework**: Proposed predictive models and recommendations for maximizing user interaction.
- **Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards using Streamlit to present key insights.
